Python files created for homework problems are in the `Homework` directory and Python files created for Lab exercises are in the `Labs` directory. Within each directory are subdirectories for each assignemnt. For example, `Labs/Lab 1` and `Homework/Homework 1`. Within these subdirectories are files for each of the specific questions or exercises.

The Python packages `numpy` and `matplotlib` are used.
